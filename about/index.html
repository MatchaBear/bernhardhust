            Hello my name is Bernhard Hustomo. People call me Berry much more
            often than <span>"Bernhard"</span>. But, recently there is a guy
            consistently call me by <span>that name</span>. Wonder why, since to
            pronounce it with my country's mother tongue, it is
            <span>HARD</span>. And the reason is confusingly weird:
            <span>so many people's names I have to remember.</span>
