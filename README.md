My name is Bernhard Hustomo.

I am a professional working outside of my country of origin.

Wishful to return to my home country for good to provide inspirational education across the archipelago.

This website is mainly inspired by <https://gal-rabaniam.com>

Other inspirations:

- for floating bottom navigation bar: <https://www.awwwards.com>
- for navigation button animation: <https://vercel.com/dashboard>

You can find my attempt to 'copy' her site [here](https://figma.com/file/BpGEDpszCKpyUQE6c6sfPs/bernhardhust.com) with Figma.
